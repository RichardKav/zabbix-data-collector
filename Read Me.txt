The zabbix data collector is designed to collect data directly from the Zabbix database.

At the start of the script is held the database connection information that will be required to be changed to match your installation details.

username=zabbix
database=zabbix
password=mypassword
hostname=10.10.0.1

Its usage is as follows: ./zabbix_data_collector.sh <Hostname> <Metric> <Start_time_unix_time> <end_time_unix_time>

An example of this is:   ./zabbix_data_collector.sh testnode1 power 1439337600 1439373722
